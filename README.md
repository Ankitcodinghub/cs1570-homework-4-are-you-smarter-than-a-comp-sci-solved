Are you Smarter than a Comp Sci?

Background:

After twelve long years of sending in video interviews and applications,

you’ve finally been accepted to compete on your favorite game show, “Are You Smarter than a Comp Sci?”. Here is how the game works in brief:

<ol>
<li>You are asked ten multiple choice trivia questions back to back. Each question will have four options.</li>
<li>You start with $100.</li>
<li>Every time you answer a question correctly, multiply your winnings by
two. Every time you get a question wrong, you lose $100.
</li>
<li>If you answer three questions incorrectly, you immediately lose, and
you walk away with $0.
</li>
<li>You are given three lifelines. These will allow you to call a friend, who
has an 80% chance of answering the question correctly, and a 20% chance of picking a random answer.
</li>
</ol>
Specifications

All of the following functions must be implemented. You may add more or use different parameters if you like, unless specifically stated otherwise. Variable names may be different in your code. Return types and parameter types are up to your own discretion.

greeting()

– This function outputs a greeting message to the user.

printQuestion(questionNumber)

– This function outputs a single multiple choice question, as well as the 4 options for answers. Remember, the questions should be asked in order, from 1 to 10.

isCorrect(questionNumber, userAnswer)

– This function returns whether or not the user answered the question correctly, based on the question number, and what the user input as their

answer. If no user answer is passed as a parameter, use a default parameter to set the user answer equal to 3.

lifeLine(questionNumber)

– This function has an 80% chance of outputting the correct answer to the current question to the user, and a 20% chance of outputting a randomly selected answer from the other 3 options. This function may only be called 3 times. To ensure this, you must use a static variable inside of this function.

answerRandomly()

– This function generates a random value between 1 and 4.

leave()

– This function allows the user to leave with their current winnings, and ends the game. No more questions will be displayed to the user.

exitMessage(winLoseOrLeave, winnings)

<ul>
<li>– &nbsp;This function prints an exit message to the user, along with their winnings. This function should be called after the user wins the game, loses the game, or decides to leave the game prematurely.</li>
<li>– &nbsp;//The “winLoseOrLeave” parameter should hold the information that contains whether the user won, lost, or left.
updateMoney(currentMoney, isCorrect)
</li>
</ul>
– This function needs to be a templated function. It will multiply the current pool of money by 2 if the user answered the question correctly, and subtract it by 100 if the user answered the question incorrectly. This function must be set up so that currentMoney can be ANY numeric data type.

Overall Program Flow

<ol>
<li>Greet the User</li>
<li>Ask the user the first question</li>
<li>Get input from the user (1, 2, 3, 4, random, lifeline, or leave).</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>If the user chose 1, 2, 3, or 4, output whether they were right or not. If they chose the random or the lifeline option, output the randomly generated answer to the question, and take their input again. If they chose a lifeline but they have no lifelines left, print a message to the user stating this fact instead of generating an answer. If the user picks leave, print an exit message to the user.</li>
<li>If the user did not leave or get 3 losses, repeat with the next question.</li>
<li>Continue this cycle until the user loses, leaves, or all 10 questions have been
asked.
</li>
<li>Print an exit message to the user, stating whether they won, lost, or left, and
output their winnings.
</li>
</ol>
Notes

<ul>
<li>● &nbsp;You can use the sample questions in the file provided, but the answers to the questions must be the same (i.e. the answer to question 1 must be 3 regardless of what the question is, the answer to question 2 must be 2 regardless of what the question is, etc.)</li>
